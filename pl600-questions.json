The client has the following requirements: • Manage all leads using the Power Apps app. • Create a lead in the Power Apps app when a user creates a lead in the third-party application. • Update leads in the Power Apps app when a user updates a lead in the third-party application. • Connect to the third-party application using an API. You need to recommend strategies to integrate the Power Apps app and the third-party application. Which three options can you use to achieve the goal?
